# Space Sustainability Project

## Overview
The Space Sustainability Project is a web-based platform designed to promote responsible orbital management by providing advanced satellite tracking and collision prevention tools. This application leverages cutting-edge technologies to monitor satellite trajectories, predict potential collisions, and contribute to a debris-free space environment for future generations.

## Features
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Monitor satellite positions with millisecond precision using TLE (Two-Line Element) data.
- **Collision Prediction**: Utilize advanced algorithms to predict potential satellite collisions up to 7 days in advance.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Explore geospatial mapping, collision hotspot identification, and customizable simulations for satellite trajectories.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Responsive design with intuitive navigation and interactive controls for seamless operation across devices.
- **Collision History**: Access historical data on satellite collisions and near-miss events, categorized by risk levels.
- **Space Sustainability Focus**: Promote debris reduction and responsible satellite operations to ensure a sustainable orbital environment.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**:
  - HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for the core structure and interactivity.
  - [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for responsive and modern styling.
  - [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) for enhanced UI components and interactivity.
- **Backend**:
  - [Python](https://www.python.org/) for custom algorithms to process satellite trajectories.
  - [satellite-js](https://github.com/shashwatak/satellite-js) for real-time satellite tracking using TLE data.
  - [ArcGIS API](https://developers.arcgis.com/) for detailed geospatial visualization of satellite orbits.
- **Other**:
  - SVG graphics for dynamic background elements like star fields.
  - Video integration for educational content on satellite collision risks.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/space-sustainability.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd space-sustainability
   ```
3. **Serve the Application**:
   - Use a local server (e.g., [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) for VS Code) or a web server like Nginx/Apache.
   - Alternatively, open `index.html` directly in a modern web browser, but note that some features (e.g., form submissions) may require a server.

## Usage
1. **Access the Platform**:
   - Open `index.html` in a browser to view the landing page.
   - Navigate through sections like Home, Collision Check, About, Research, News, and Contact using the top navigation bar.
2. **Collision Check**:
   - Visit the `collision.html` page to interact with the satellite collision prediction tool.
   - Use filters to select satellites by country, orbital altitude, or type.
   - Explore real-time orbit tracking and collision hotspot visualizations.
3. **Feedback**:
   - Submit feedback via the Contact Us form on the landing page.
